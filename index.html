            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">The new National Education Policy 2020 (NEP 2020) introduced by the central government is expected to bring profound
            changes to education in India. The policy approved by the Union Cabinet of India on 29 July 2020, outlines the vision of
            India's new education system. The new policy replaces the 1986 National Policy on Education. The policy is a
            comprehensive framework for elementary education to higher education as well as vocational training in both rural and
            urban India. The policy aims to transform India's education system by 2021. </p>

            <p class="sectionTag text-big">Lets grow together</p>
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Poorly resourced public schools which suffer from high rates of teacher absenteeism may have encouraged the rapid growth
            of private (unaided) schooling in India, particularly in urban areas. Private schools divide into two types: recognised
            and unrecognised schools. Government ‘recognition’ is an official stamp of approval and for this a private school is
            required to fulfil a number of conditions, though hardly any private schools that get ‘recognition’ actually fulfil all
            the conditions of recognition. The emergence of large numbers of unrecognised primary schools suggests that schools and
            parents do not take government recognition as a stamp of quality. Although there are private schools in India, they are highly regulated in terms of what they can teach, in what form
            they can operate (must be a non-profit to run any accredited educational institution) and all the other aspects of
            operation. Hence, the differentiation of government schools and private schools can be misleading. Need to make an announcement that our government is not just only misleading they are 
            currupt also and no one can stop it because of a huge chain in between the governmnet and private organisation. If we look closely there are aomthing about 70 to 80 % of organizations 
            which is really not in an organzied manner, and this unorganized sector includes all the other people of the country who dont have a job but they are making money and surviving through
            this huge unorganzied sector.</p>
